AWS System Manager Run Command - Hands-On Lab

Many organizations have strict controls that prevent the use of bastion hosts or direct SSH/RDP remote access to servers from the Internet. This reduces the attack surface for critical computing services that are hosted in the cloud.

AWS System Manager offers several tools that enable remote and secure management of EC2 Instances, edge devices, and on-premises servers or virtual machines (VM) in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager. 

In this video, we look at one such too: AWS System Manager Run Command. You can use Run Command from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, or the AWS SDKs to remotely administer your server farms. You can use the Run Command to install applications, build a deployment pipeline, capture log files, join instances to a Windows domain, and more. Run Command is offered at no additional cost.
